#week 1
- We've had an introduction to DISMATH

#week 2 
- I've learned how important the truth table is for proving statements
- memorizing and undertsanding a truth table is essential. 
- a proposition must always be a declarative sentence 
- I've learned about the following: negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, biconditional and implications
- learned how to do bitwise logical operations

#week 3
- I've learned how to prove statements by using logical statements 
- validity and truth is different 
- conclusion is dependent on the premises
- differences of the two quantifiers 
- I've learned how to use the rules of inference
- it is important to know if an argument is fallacy or not

#week 4
- I've learned about the different methods of proof such as direct proof and the types of direct proof
- In addition to that, little by little I'm learning when to use direct or indirect proof
- Proof by contraposition and contradiction are indirect methods of proof
- I've learned about vacuous and trivial proof

#week 5
- I've learned about proof by equivalence
- We had mathematical induction just like in our engalg2 class
- We were introduced to recursive/ inductive definition
- In addition to that, I learned about recursive algorithm, program correctness and hoare triple
- I've learned something about power series 
- Our last lesson for the week was about sets 

#week 6
- We discussed about functions
- functions can also be referred to as mappings or transformations
- I've learned the difference between range and codomain
- one to one function --> no value in the range is  used by more than one value in the domain
- onto function--> equal range and codomain 
- bijection --> one-to-one and onto
