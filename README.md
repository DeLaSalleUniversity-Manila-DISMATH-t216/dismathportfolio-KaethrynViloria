#week 1
- We've had an introduction to DISMATH

#week 2 
- I've learned how important the truth table is for proving statements
- memorizing and undertsanding a truth table is essential. 
- a proposition must always be a declarative sentence 
- I've learned about the following: negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, biconditional and implications
- learned how to do bitwise logical operations

#week 3
- I've learned how to prove statements by using logical statements 
- validity and truth is different 
- conclusion is dependent on the premises
- differences of the two quantifiers 
- I've learned how to use the rules of inference
- it is important to know if an argument is fallacy or not
- for order of quantifiers, I've learned that the order of ∃ and ∀ matters in evaluating whether a particular function is true for all x or for some x only.

#week 4
- I've learned about the different methods of proof such as direct proof and the types of direct proof
- In addition to that, little by little I'm learning when to use direct or indirect proof
- Proof by contraposition and contradiction are indirect methods of proof
- I've learned about vacuous and trivial proof

#week 5
- I've learned about proof by equivalence
- We had mathematical induction just like in our engalg2 class
- We were introduced to recursive/ inductive definition
- In addition to that, I learned about recursive algorithm, program correctness and hoare triple
- I've learned something about power series 
- Our last lesson for the week was about sets 

#week 6
- We discussed about functions
- based from our classes in anageom and engalg1, I've reviewed the graphsof different functions
- functions can also be referred to as mappings or transformations
- I've learned the difference between range and codomain
- one to one function --> no value in the range is  used by more than one value in the domain
- onto function--> equal range and codomain 
- bijection --> one-to-one and onto 

#week 7
- no classes for the week

#week 8
- We started learning about algorithms
- Algorithm for finding the maximum element
- An algorithm must have a precondition and postcondition
- I also learned what a pseudocode is
- Properties of an algorithm: input, output, definiteness, correctness, finiteness


#week 9
- We discussed about linear search algorithm and binary search algorithm 
- Check the algorithms at: (docs/DISMATH quiz 2 reviewer.md)

#week 10
- we discussed about the bubble sort algorithm 
- I learned about the insertion sort algorithm 
- I also learned about the greedy algorithm
- for the discussions, I learned what each component of the algorithm performs (example: outer for loop in the insertion sort algorithm is responsible for the movement of elements) 

#week 11
- We discussed about Big- O, big- omega and big- theta 
- big-O is known as the upper bound while big-omega describes the lower bound of the function.
- in addition to that, big-theta is for both upper and lower bound
- We also discussed about the algorithm time complexity
- I learned about division and modulo operator
- I also learned about Caesar Cipher.

#week 12
- no classes for the week

#week 13
- I've learned about graph theory.
- It is important to remember this notation: G= (V,E). The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with it. Counting the degree is important for the handshaking theorem.
- The handshaking theorem is stated as : 2e= Σ deg(v) 
- An Euler circuit contains every edge of the graph and the nodes of the graph have even degrees. An Euler path is a simple path that contains every edge of the graph and there are exactly two nodes with odd degrees. 
- A Hamilton path is a simple path that passes through every node exactly once. The Hamilton circuit passes through every node exactly once and covers all nodes. Dirac's theorem states that if a graph has n vertices which is greater than or equal to 3 and the degree of every vertex is at least n/2 then the graph has a Hamilton circuit. For Ore's theorem, it states that if a graph has n vertices which is greater than or equal to 3 such that deg(u) + deg(v) is greater than or equal to n then the graph has a Hamilton circuit.
- A planar graph is a graph which can be drawn without any edges crossing (rearrange if necessary).
- To know the number of regions a planar graph has, use Euler's formula which is r = e-v+2. 
- Kuratowski's theorem states that when a graph has a subgraph of K 3,3 or K 5 then it is not planar. 

#week 14
- graph coloring is helpful because you can see if two nodes (or islands) are adjacent or not.
- in graph coloring, recycling of colors is important, and we must get the minimum number of colors which is known as the chromatic number.
- The four color theorem states that for a planar graph, the chromatic number is no greater than four.
- A cycle is a graph with a complete loop; furthermore, if it has odd nodes then it has 3 colors, otherwise, it has 2 colors for graph coloring. 
- A tree is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits. Futhermore, I've learned about the rooted tree, m-ary tree, ordered rooted tree and properties of trees.
- We discussed about modeling computation. 
- I've learned that a compiler is a program that reads a program written in a source language then translates it into the target language. Furthermore, in programming, we are concerned only with the syntax or form. 
- I've learned about the finite automaton and how to trace it.
